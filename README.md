Take-Home Assignment: Few-Shot Learning with Mini Dataset  

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   Inspect the dataset.
   Visualize sample images from each class.

2. Prepare the data for few-shot learning.
   Data augmentation that I am using, Color jittering and random rotation can help to make the model more robust to variations in the input data.

3. Model and Training : 
   i) When it is implemented as it is.

  ii) With the Nearest Mean Classifier.
